                Hi!, My name is Tantham Tanthuvanit but you can
                call me Tan. Here's some background information on me, I was born
                on the 10th of january 2010. I Started my fascination with computers
                since I was about 10. My father and mother were both software
                engineers, I started by making video games in Roblox. They weren't
                very good at the time but I was proud of them. Then I moved to the
                Unity game engine, It was a much more powerful and complicated
                engine than Roblox but I had my parents to teach me the basics of
                programming. After a while I began experimenting with different sectors of
                programming such as web development, machine learning, app development and so on.
                All of this was learnt on youtube tutorials. I love programming and I want to do It
                as my full time job (partly because it pays well). I wish to gon to study at MIT (Top 1 
                ranked university in the world) and start my own startup, then retire by the time im 30.
            </p>
